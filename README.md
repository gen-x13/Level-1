### **💭 My thoughts on this project:**  
This is my **first project**, and I’m really proud of it! 🎉  
- It took me **3 days** to build the first version.  
- I spent **8 days in total** because I had to correct it multiple times.  

It was a great learning experience, and I improved my understanding of **linear regression** and **data preprocessing**.

💡 My strengths: Determination & Creativity.

🚀 Areas for improvement: Code optimization (perhaps in a future project 👀).
